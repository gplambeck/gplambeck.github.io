## About Me

----------

I graduated from Sierra College in fall of 2006. While at Sierra I accomplished a few Associate degrees. Two of them in computers, **A.S. Computer Information Systems** and **A.S. Computer Applications**, and one an **Associate of Science in Mathematics**. In the spring of 2011, I graduated from California State University, Sacramento with a **Bachelor of Arts in Pure Mathematics**. I came back to Sierra in the fall of 2016 to update my computer skills. Last fall I earned an **Associate of Arts in Applied Art & Design-Digital Media**.

So far, my computer experience is in:

- Microsoft Office Suite
- Microsoft Windows
- HTML5
- Java
- macOS
- Adobe CC Suite
- Maya
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

While I have been advancing my computer skills, I've been teaching myself the Python language. I've been learning from books that use older versions of Python. Although I've been successful at learning some of the basic skills, every now and then I come across codes that don't work. Most of the time I can figure out why, but sometimes I can’t find a solution to the errors I get. I am taking IT75 - Python for Many Uses to learn the language better and gain the skills needed to apply for jobs.

What might prevent me from doing well in this class is trying to remember all the codes. That is why I keep my computer books and make notes of codes I know I will constantly need. I also like to leave comments to myself in my code of what the code does, so I have a reference for a later project.

The most important thing in my life is my family. I like to go on family trips and make a lot of memories to look back on. One of my projects, now that I have the Photoshop skills, is to condense the family photo albums to digital.

I am a big fan of Star Wars and Star Trek. I always enjoy well told and thought out stories. When I was taking the AAD classes at Sierra, I was always trying to go beyond the lessons and learn how to advance the graphic skills I learned.
