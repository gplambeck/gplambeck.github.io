## About Me

I graduated from Sierra College in fall of 2006. While at Sierra I accomplished a few Associate's degrees. Two of them in computers, A.S. Computer Information Systems and A.S. Computer Applications, and one an Associate of Science in Mathematics. In the spring of 2011 I graduated from California State University, Sacramento with a Bachelor of Arts in Pure Mathematics. I came back to Sierra in the fall of 2016 to update my computer skills. Last fall I earned an Associate of Arts in Applied Art & Design-Digital Media.

So far my computer experience is in:
