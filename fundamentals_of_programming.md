## Python Basics

----------

I began with learning the basics of the Python language. First, I created a variable, printed it, then changed its value and had the new value printed. Then, I created a file to show how quotation marks are printed to the screen. Next, I stored a number in a variable and converted the variable to a string so that I can use the variable to create a string message. Lastly, I used the len() function to count the number of characters that are in a string.

Files go here.

I created the following program to explore the turtle graphics system. I write some code to move a pen around the screen and change the pen's color and width to draw the image seen above.
