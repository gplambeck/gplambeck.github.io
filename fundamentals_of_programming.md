## Python Basics

----------

I began with learning the basics of the Python language. First, I created a variable, printed it, then changed its value and had the new value printed. Then, I created a file to show how quotation marks are printed to the screen. Next, I stored a number in a variable and converted the variable to a string so that I can use the variable to create a string message. Lastly, I used the len() function to count the number of characters that are in a string.

## Turtle

I created the following program to explore the turtle graphics system. The codes I used moved a pen around the screen and change the pen's color and width to draw the image seen above.

## Calculation

----------

The goal here was to use Python's math operators to estimate the number of trees in Sacramento.

## Creating A Simple Game

----------

This simple game of Rock - Paper - Scissors, is a good example of working with conditionals. The entire program relies on evaluating if a condition is met then do this else if the condition is not met then do something else. I decided to take the progaram a step further and code it to that popular game of Rock - Paper - Scissors - Lizard - Spock.

## Password Generator

----------

The password generator is a good example of how random itmes from a list can be chosen by the computer. Since this is a *password* generating program, it was also useful to lean how to use the .replace(str1, str2) and .capitalize() methods to generate more secure passwords.
